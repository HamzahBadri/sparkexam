My project for the Data Academy Stage 2 Spark exam.

Question 1 is encompassed by the CustomerAccountOutputCreator Scala object, which outputs the required Dataset.
Question 2 is encompassed by the CustomerDocumentCreator Scala object, which outputs the required Dataset.
The object CreateBothDocuments runs both the above objects, generates the Datasets and saves them as parquet files.
